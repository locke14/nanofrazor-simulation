## Nanofrazor Working Principle

Thermal Scanning Probe Lithography – the technology behind the NanoFrazor, was invented at IBM Research in Zurich. The standard process is a subtractive technique where material is selectively removed from a surface and could be described as “inverse 3D printing on the nanoscale”. 

The animation below (generated by exporting this simulation as a video) illustrates the patterning principle:
