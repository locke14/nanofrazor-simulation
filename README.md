# Nanofrazor Working Principle

Thermal Scanning Probe Lithography – the technology behind the NanoFrazor, was invented at IBM Research in Zurich. The standard process is a subtractive technique where material is selectively removed from a surface and could be described as “inverse 3D printing on the nanoscale”. The animation rendered in this project illustrates the patterning principle.
